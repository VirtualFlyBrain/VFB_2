# VFB 2.0 Technical spec

STATUS: DRAFT

## Tech overview

* Web FrameWork:  
   * Boostrap 
      - support for multiple browsers/platforms
      - Choice of templates for header, footer, search results, css.
  * ThymeLeaf:
    * Binding to SOLR => dynamic content
    * Good for rapid protyping 

* Dynamic content and auto-suggest search are provided by SOLR

* Semantic queries use an Brain query endpoint:
   * POST/GET using JSON.
   * Returns lists of IDs.

### SOLR

We have provisionally decided to re-use code from [OLS2.0](https://github.com/EBISPOT/OLS).  This takes any set of specified OWL files and stores content as indexed JSON. It is also set up to provide autocomplete tuned in accordance with [VFB 2 spec](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/VFB_2/blob/master/specs/functional_specs.md#autosuggest-search) (THIS STILL NEEDS TO BE CHECKED).



__Limitations of OLS:__

* Doesn't yet support OWL individuals
  *  Extending to support individuals has to be a priority for work with OLS 2 dev(s).

* We need a model for indexing content not (yet) in OWL, e.g. information on features, expression and phenotypes in FlyBase.
  * The easiest way to do this may be to convert to OWL - we are already doing this for some expression pattern data.  But will this => all the information we need?
  * An alternative is to extend the SOLR schema to store content from FlyBase, derived from SQL queries.

__Content to index for autocomplete__

* Names, synonyms and IDs for anatomical classes
* Names, synonyms and IDs for anatomical individuals
* Names, synonyms and IDs for genetic features in FlyBase that have either neuro-expression or neuro-phenotypes.
* Behavioural phenotypes ontology terms (?)
* ? Chemicals (based on DoOR mapping of oderants) ?

__Autosuggest results feedback__

Autosuggest results will include contextual information to help users quickly understand the nature of hits.  This will work via...
