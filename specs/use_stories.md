# VFB 2.0 User stories

STATUS: DRAFT

Users are typically busy, wet-lab biologists who want to be able to rapidly find: 
  - reagents that drive expression in specific neurons, 
  - papers about specific types of neurons,
  - candidate neurons belonging to circuits of interest  
  
They need to be able to sift rapidly through large volumes of information in order to find these.  VFB aims to automate this sifting process as far as possible. Well defined semantics
and high quality datasets allow VFB to serve and accurate lists of candidates.  Users then need information and tools to refine these often long lists and to assess the quality of their results. Once users have identified candidate 3D registered images or lists of results,  they need the option to download these in order to be able to use desktop tools for analysis.


Some characters:
Sarah, a regular fly biologist with little neuro background whose favourite gene, ketchup has an allele with a behavioral/neuroanatomical phenotype, she wants to find.

Ayako: A postdoc trying to dissect the circuitry underlying a newly discovered ocellar sensory pathways. She wants to find new candidate neurons in the circuit and to find transgenes to drive expression candidate neurons and other neurons in the circuit.
