# VFB 2.0 User stories

STATUS: DRAFT

Users are typically busy, wet-lab biologists who want to be able to rapidly find: 
  - reagents that drive expression in specific neurons, 
  - papers about specific types of neurons,
  - candidate neurons belonging to circuits of interest  
  
They need to be able to sift rapidly through large volumes of information in order to find these.  VFB aims to automate this sifting process as far as possible. Well defined semantics
and high quality datasets allow VFB to serve and accurate lists of candidates.  Users then need information and tools to refine these often long lists and to assess the quality of their results. Once users have identified candidate 3D registered images or lists of results,  they need the option to download these in order to be able to use desktop tools for analysis.


Some characters:

Sarah: a regular fly biologist with little neuro background whose favourite gene, ketchup has an allele with a behavioral and neuroanatomical phenotypes, she wants to find:
    Other genes whose alleles have similar phenotypes
    



Ayako: A postdoc trying to dissect the circuitry underlying a newly discovered ocellar sensory pathways. She wants to find new candidate neurons in the circuit and to find transgenes to drive expression in these and other neurons in the circuit.  The story has to outline:
      (a) How she will find records for known neurons in this pathway?
          Query by name
          Query by function?
      (b) How she will find known and potential drivers for these neurons?
      (c) How she will find potential circuit partners

Giorgio: A Drosophila neurobiologist who is reasonably experienced at image manipulation.  He has lots of images of single neurons that he want to use to query by image to: 
     (a) Find out if they map to known neurons
     (b) Find known and potential drivers
