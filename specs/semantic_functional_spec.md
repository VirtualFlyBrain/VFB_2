# Semantic functional spec

1. Given a specified construct, find all the neuron (classes) that are encompassed by the expression pattern of that construct.
1. Given a specified neuron (class), find all known or predicted circuit partners.  Circuit partner prediction is on the basis of proximity of arbor or synapse location via image analysis or direct semantic assertion of synaptic location to some neuropil subdomain (layer, glomerulus, focus etc).
1. Given a specified neuron (class), list all the drivers known or predicted to be expressed in that neuron.
1. Given a(n uploaded) neuron tracing, predict what neuron class it belongs to / find similar neuron images.
1. Given a(n uploaded) neuron tracing, predict what drivers express in that neuron.
