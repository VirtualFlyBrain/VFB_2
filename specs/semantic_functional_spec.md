# Semantic functional spec

A list of questions that should be answerable using the site. This should be phrased in the language of biology - or at least in the language used by biologists. It should not be limited to questions answerable via OWL queries, but should exclude lexical (name-based) searches.

1. Given a specified construct, find all the neuron (classes) that are encompassed by the expression pattern of that construct.
1. Given a specified neuron (class), find all known or predicted direct or indirect circuit partners.  Circuit partner prediction is on the basis of proximity of arbor or synapse location via image analysis or direct semantic assertion of synaptic location to some neuropil subdomain (layer, glomerulus, focus etc).  Indirect circuit partner prediction should work directionally 1-2 jumps along known synaptic connections.
1. Given a specified neuron (class), list all the drivers known or predicted to be expressed in that neuron.
1. Given a(n uploaded) neuron tracing, predict what neuron class it belongs to / find similar neuron images.
1. Given a(n uploaded) neuron tracing, predict what drivers express in that neuron.
1. Given a region of neuropil, find all neurons with that are kown or predicted to overlap the region or with synapses in that region, optionally specifying pre or post synaptic terminals.
1. Given a neuron class, find all known phenotypes
1. Given a sensory or other neuronal function, find all neurons and genes known or predicted to be capable of carrying out some part of that function.
