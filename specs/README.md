# Virtual Fly Brain version 2 specs

STATUS: DRAFT

* [Use case stories](use_stories.md)
Some fictional, but hopefully realistic scenarios for how we expect
the website to be used.  This should guide the functional spec / semantic functional spec.
* [Functional specs](functional_specs.md)
A description of how the site should function
* [Technical specs](tech_specs.md)
A description of how the functionality is achieved.
* [Semantic functional spec](semantic_functional_spec.md)
A list of questions that should be answerable using the site. This should be phrased in the language of biology - or at least in the language used by biologists. It should not be limited to questions answerable via OWL queries, but should exclude lexical (name-based) searches.
* [Semantic techinical spec](semantic_technical_spec.md)
The technical details of how the site answers questions detailed in the semantic functional spec.  This includes, but it not limited to, the details of OWL queries used to answer these questions.

* Schemas
  * [OWL schema](owl_schema.md)
