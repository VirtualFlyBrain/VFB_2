# Virtual Fly Brain version 2 specs

STATUS: DRAFT

* [Functional specs](functional_specs.md)
A description of how the site should function
* [Technical specs](tech_specs.md)
A description of how the functionality is achieved.
* [Use case stories](use_stories.md)
Some fictional, but hopefully realistic scenarios for how we expect
the website to be used.  This should guide the functional spec / semantic functional spec.
* [Semantic functional spec](semantic_functional_spec.md)
A list of questions that can be answered using the site. This should be phrased in the language of biology - or at least in the language used by biologists.
* [Semantic techinical spec](semantic_technical_spec.md)
The technical details of how the site answers questions detailed in the semantic functional spec.  This includes, but it not limited to, the details of OWL queries used to answer these questions.

* Schemas
  * [OWL schema](owl_schema.md)
